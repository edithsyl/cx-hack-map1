# Cathay Hackathon 2022: CX travel - Planning a worry-free trip for you.
 
This is a repository for 2022 CX Hackathon PoC.

## Background
Traditionally, travel plans were created either by travelers themselves or through travel agencies. However, we believe that airline companies possess valuable data that can optimize the travel experience by integrating an easy-to-use travel planning function into their flight ticket booking systems or smartphone applications. With our app, travelers can plan a personalized and optimized travel route with just a single click.

## Business Value
Our app allows airline companies to act as personal assistants, helping travelers handle various tasks such as researching tourist spots and planning their routes. By providing this integrated travel planning system, airline companies can significantly improve the overall travel experience and enhance their company image.

## Features
### Obtain Preference Information
The app utilizes previous data collected by the airline company to understand the traveler's preferences. Additionally, it asks specific questions to gather detailed preferences that may not be covered by the collected data.

### Suggestion and Selection of Places
Using machine learning (ML), Google Cloud, or other technologies, the app maintains a database that categorizes tourist spots based on different preferences. The system compares the traveler's choices with the spots in the database to provide suitable suggestions. Travelers can view thumbnails and simple descriptions of the suggested places to make informed decisions. They can add favored spots to their wish list or ignore those that do not interest them.

### Generate Optimal Traveling Plan and Provide Navigation
The app offers a map view to facilitate decision-making based on the geographic locations of the places. Once the traveler has finalized their selection, they can click the "Generate Route" button to create an optimized travel plan. The app considers factors such as travel days, geographic locations of spots, and characteristics of places to arrange the most efficient itinerary.

### Promote CX-Related Vendors
In collaboration with customer experience (CX) partners, the app promotes vendors and services related to the travel destinations. This feature enhances the overall travel experience by providing recommendations and discounts for accommodations, transportation, and other relevant services.
